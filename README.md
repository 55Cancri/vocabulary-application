## Vocabulary

This application allows users to collect and share interesting words that they come across in books, movies, conversations and anywhere else where words are the medium of exchange for information. Users can sort the words they find into topics and build lists to further categorize them with personalized relationships.

In order for users to add words to their collections, they must provide their own definitions. In this way, users can phrase the definition of words in ways that make sense to them. The alternative would be to query the api of another dictionary application and receive a definition that may be vague or unhelpful in its explanation. However, the downside to this approach is that there is no built-in error correcting mechanism to assess the accuracy of a user's definition. In the future, we plan to incorporate a ranking system for definitions so that definition accuracy can be determined by consesus.
